#+TITLE: OpenReil-OCaml

OCaml bindings to OpenREIL. (Work in progress)

Only tested on Linux. 


* Installation
  Get and install OpenREIL from [[https://github.com/Cr4sh/openreil][this repo]]. 

  At the moment the bindings assume that OpenReil has been installed under /usr/local

  Build it

  
* Using the bindings

  There are two options to build against the bindings. By default openreil builds a static library (libopenreil.a)

  1. Static linking

     Use the following gcc flags:

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     -Wl,--whole-archive /usr/local/lib/libopenreil.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive -Wl,-E -lstdc++
     #+END_SRC


  2. Dynamic linking

     To do this we need to build a shared library from the static library.

     Convert the static library to a shared library:
     
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     ar -x libopenreil.a
     gcc -shared *.o -o libopenreil.so -lstdc++
     #+END_SRC

     Then open the resulting so file to /usr/local/lib
     
     Then pass the linking options to the compiler:
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     -lopenreil -lstdc++
     #+END_SRC

     Before executing the resultant executable make sure the path to
     the so file is included in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
